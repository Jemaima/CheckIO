#    Help Sofia write a decrypter for the passwords that Nikola
# will encrypt through the cipher map. A cipher grille is
# a 4Ã—4 square of paper with four windows cut out. Placing
# the grille on a paper sheet of the same size, the encoder
# writes down the first four symbols of his password inside
# the windows (see fig. below). After that, the encoder
# turns the grille 90 degrees clockwise. The symbols written
# earlier become hidden under the grille and clean paper
# appears inside the windows. The encoder then writes down
# the next four symbols of the password in the windows and
# turns the grille 90 degrees again. Then, they write down
# the following four symbols and turns the grille once more.
#    Lastly, they write down the final four symbols of the password.
# Without the same cipher grille, it is difficult to discern
# the password from the resulting square comprised of 16 symbols.
# Thus, the encoder can be confident that no hooligan will easily
# gain access to the locked door.
